# UOR Foundation Official Homepage Repository

**Call to all Old Skool webpage developers!!!**

**In need of plain HTML code!!!**

Welcome to the **UOR Foundation Homepage** [**Repository**](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/uor-homepage), the central hub for the development and maintenance of the **OFFICIAL UOR Foundation** [**Homepage**](https://uor-foundation.github.io/uor-homepage/). 

The [**Official UOR Fundation Homepage**](https://uor-foundation.github.io/uor-homepage/) serves as the authoritative entry point for everything related to the UOR Foundation, providing access to all people, projects, content, and governance materials.


The [**Official UOR Fundation Homepage**](https://uor-foundation.github.io/uor-homepage/) is your portal to all other UOR webpages designed in accordance with the three (3) policies in this repo.

This repository embraces the philosophy of simplicity, using **pure HTML** to create *form* combined with the power of **GitHub Actions** to create *function*al, elegant, and efficient web pages without relying on JavaScript, CSS, or other additional languages.

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to:
- The overall development of new devops workflows in support of the UOR Machine.
- Demonstrating the power of **pure HTML** as a foundational tool for creating accessible and elegant websites.
- Leveraging **GitHub Actions** for backend automation, content updates, and dynamic functionality without introducing additional complexity.
- Providing a central entry point for all UOR Foundation resources, adhering to the principle of simplicity and the **3-click rule**.

## Philosophy
The UOR Foundation Homepage embodies a minimalist design philosophy that aligns with early web principles:
1. **Simplicity:** Pure HTML ensures that the website is lightweight, easy to maintain, and <u>universally</u> accessible.
2. **Functionality through Automation:** GitHub Actions handle dynamic tasks like generating content, indexing files, or deploying updates, removing the need for JavaScript or server-side processing.
3. **Focus on Content:** By avoiding unnecessary embellishments, the emphasis remains on delivering clear, relevant, and accessible information.

# Co-create a Safe, Friendly, & Creative Community
The UOR Foundation casts a wide net to attract developers from all over. Respect & kindness are values we practice, hold and react to positively. Other acts demostrated by members that do not fall under kindness & respect will be ignored or properly handled for removal* to ensure a friendly, safe & creative environment. 

We will always maintain the desire to co-create a friendly and open community. We believe a foundation grounded in **respect & kindness** is the key to a friendly and open community.

We also believe in forgiveness...creating new and exciting software will inevitably create disagreements. Disagreements lead to frustrations. Frustrations lead to loud words. And loud wor...well you get the idea. We make mistakes. Just stick to respect & kindness and have fun!

 Now back to business!

## Three Policies for Developers:

### 1. **Pure HTML for All Content**
- Use **HTML only** for creating pages.
- Avoid relying on JavaScript or CSS for interactivity or styling.
- Keep the design clean and functional, reminiscent of early web aesthetics.

### 2. **Leveraging GitHub Actions**
GitHub Actions enable functionality traditionally handled by scripts or server-side processes:
- **Dynamic Content Updates:** Automatically generate or update pages based on repository changes.
- **File Indexing:** Scan and list files (e.g., PDFs, blog posts) dynamically.
- **Deployment:** Ensure all changes to the `main` branch are deployed seamlessly to GitHub Pages.
- **You:** How will you leverage GitHub Actions?

Example workflow for generating an index of PDFs:
```yaml
name: Generate PDF Index

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Generate index.html
      run: |
        echo '<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>PDF Index</h1><ul>' > index.html
        find . -name "*.pdf" | sed 's|^./||' | while read -r file; do
          echo "<li><a href='$file'>$file</a></li>" >> index.html
        done
        echo '</ul></body></html>' >> index.html

    - name: Commit and Push Changes
      run: |
        git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
        git config user.email "actions@github.com"
        git add index.html
        git commit -m "Update PDF index"
        git push
```

### 3. **Maintaining Simplicity**
- Focus on plain content delivery.
- Avoid dependencies or external libraries.
- Use simple inline styles sparingly to enhance readability where necessary.

## Contributing
- Contributions must adhere to the repositoryâ€™s simplicity-first approach.
- Use **pull requests** for any changes, ensuring they align with the purpose of the repository.
- Avoid introducing JavaScript, CSS frameworks, or other languages unless absolutely, and we mean ABSOLUTELY, necessary.

## Deployment
This repository is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages. Changes pushed to the `main` branch are reflected at:
```
https://uor-foundation.github.io/uor-homepage/
```

## Repository Structure
This repository's file and folder structure is under construction...

## Vision
The UOR Foundation Homepage demonstrates how combining the elegance of pure HTML with the automation capabilities of GitHub Actions can create powerful, maintainable, and user-focused websites. It challenges the modern tendency toward over-engineering, proving that simplicity can coexist with robust & rich functionality.
